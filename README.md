# PlinkoBoard2

Using MATLAB
Model probabilities of the plinko board with an adjustable board size.

This project builds off of my "PlinkoBoard" repo. 
I run trials to see the probability that a chip dropped at a given spot 
at the top of a Plinko board ends up in a given spot at the bottom of the board.

See "Instructions" file for more information on the code output.
